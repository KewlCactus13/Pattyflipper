# Pattyflipper
silly little pattyflipper game for flavortown :>
dont bully for bad code please, again (as mentioned in my pong project) im pretty new to html and js so dont be harsh please!

main mechanics:
use your trusty spatula to flip and grill patties, earn points for doing so successfully
but dont drop the patty otherwise you will need to start again (with a new patty, not the same one) >:(

i plan to at least change:
- the textues (maybe)
- the mechanics
- the score system
  
and thats about it -_-
ofc remember to have fun :> -kewlcactus13
